# Core-v4 Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as 
contributors and maintainers, pledge to making participation in our project 
and our community a harassment-free experience â€” regardless of age, gender, 
expression, level of experience, race, religion, or sexual identity and 
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Using threads on Slack

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and unconstructive criticsm
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Not using threads on Slack

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project space as well as in the SCE Slack 
and Discord.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting to SCE at sce.sjsu@gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
