## Setup and Dependencies
This project was built in the Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 LTS Linux environment, and was built on
- Node.js v8.9.1+
- ExpressJS NPM package v4.16.2+
- Body-Parser NPM package v1.18.2+
- JQuery v3.2.1+
- MongoDB Official Driver NPM package v2.2.33+
- Node Hash NPM package v0.2.0+

#### On Linux/Mac
  - You can acquire **Node.js** from *nodejs.org* or through the command line using *apt-get*. Verify installation using *node -v* on command line.
  - To acquire the other packages, you will need **npm** (the Node Package Manager), which comes pre-installed with Node.js. To verify its installation, you can run *npm -v* on command line.
  - Install required Node.js Packages (all listed in package.json under 'dependencies'):
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  - Install MongoDB locally on your machine (follow the relevant installation instructions on MongoDB's website)

#### On Windows
  - You can install **Node.js** directly from their website using their installer. Afterwards, you can perform the same Linux/Mac verification and package installation steps (displayed above) by using Windows command prompt or PowerShell

---

## Application Execution
#### On Linux/Mac/Windows
  _**BEFORE**_ starting the server, be sure to perform necessary common resource setup described in the [Common Resources Readme](./util/common/README.md). Then, initialize the database by first starting your mongo daemon with access control enabled (see [MongoDB Authentication Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/enable-authentication/)), and by then running the [database setup script](./mdbi/tools/sce_db_setup_v0.js) using
  ```
  node sce_db_setup_v0.js
  ```
  to create the necessary collections required by the mongo database.

  To run the server on Linux/Mac/Windows command line, you can use
  ```
  node server.js
  ```
  in the project's root directory. It runs the webserver on port 8080 by default. The server also checks that your MongoDB server is online before running, else it throws an error and fails startup. Make sure you have started your MongoDB server (see MongoDB's website for installation instructions relevant to your system) _**before**_ running server.js.

  Once this is done, you may simply pop open your favorite web browser and enter ```https://localhost:8080``` (or whichever port you launched the server in), and the webpage should be properly displayed.

      1. \*.html - any of the subapp's main html files are stored directly in the ```skeleton/``` directory
      1. css/ - a skeleton css directory, where your sub-app's css files go
      1. js/ - a skeleton javascript directory, where your sub-app's js files go
      1. img/ - a skeleton image/graphics directory, where your sub-app should look for image content
    1. lib/ - (optional) a directory containing core or common front-end files and resources (i.e. fonts, common utilties, and common angular components). It contains the following directories:
      1. components/ - houses various common angularjs components
      1. fonts/ - a collection of common font files that can be used to style your webpage
      1. utility.js - a set of handy utility functions commonly used by your subapp's html pages and javascript files.

      1. components/ - contains various AngularJS components exclusively used by the Core-v4 Admin Portal.
  - Any added HTML files can go directly in /public
#### */server.js*
  - This file comprises the MEAN stack webserver that will be serving all requests with the relevant endpoints.
#### */util/*
  - This directory contains various utility files for server.js, and includes
    1. settings.js - file containing core server settings
    1. logger.js - a server utility that allows server.js to log various events to logfiles in the /log/ directory
    1. route_handlers.js - a collection of endpoint handler callbacks to service the different requests coming to the server for various endpoints.
    1. www.js - a collection of https request method wrappers designed to perform HTTPS web reqeuests and configuration in a consistent manner.

    1. cryptic.js - a set of custom encryption function wrappers (primarily for password and session token hashing)
    1. common/ - a directory housing various resources commonly required by many of the server subapps and modules (including, but not limited to, security-related items)
#### */test/*
  - This directory contains a MongoDB Test Interface App used for testing basic database transactions. Previously routed within route_handlers.js, the Test Interface is now housed in its own app to be used as a sub-app by server.js. The following files are contained within it:
    1. app.js - the ExpressJS sub-app that links all requests to the "/test" endpoint
    1. testRoutes/index.js - the ExpressJS router that routes all "/test" endpoint requests
#### */mdbi/*

#### */smci/*
  - This directory contains the SMCI module, a set of api wrappers for MailChimp using their REST-ful apis. All transactions to MailChimp are performed by this module, either as a stand-alone include or as an ExpressJS sub-app (much like the mdbi; this is the intended use). See the internal README for more details on relevant api wrappers and their associated endpoints. The following files are contained within it:
    1. smci.js - the collection of MailChimp api wrapper functions
    1. smci_settings.js - settings used to associate the SMCI module with a MailChimp account, enabling granting access to their services via the wrapper functions
    1. README - an internal readme describing the SMCI module
#### */unit-tests/*
  - This directory houses any unit tests that were required for testing the individual modules. Unit testing was done using the Mocha/Chai unit-testing framework
#### */files/*
  - This directory includes various documentation-related files and images, and doesn't provide any particular function affecting the server or its use.

## Using the MEANserver
#### Endpoint Creation
  - Endpoints are declared in **server.js**. To create an endpoint having a URI of "*/someEndpoint*", the express.js **app.get()** or **app.post()** methods can be used (depending on your desired request type). By using one of these methods, you can effectively associate an endpoint name (i.e. "*/someEndpoint*") with a handler function to service any requests to it. The available handler functions are imported from the **handle_map** object within **route_handlers.js**. Let's assume that you expect this endpoint to receive POST requests. Therefore, after creating a handler function "*someEndpointHandler*" in the **handle_map** to service your request, associating it is simply done in **server.js** using the line
  ```javascript
  app.post("/someEndpoint", handles.someEndpointHandler);
  ```
#### Adding Webpages
  - You can add new webpages to the server by first assigning an endpoint to serve the page (see the **Endpoint Creation** section for more details). Afterwards, you can place your webpage files in the relevant sections of the **/public** directory.

---

## Stable Endpoint Map
#### Description
  - This section lists and describes the **stable** endpoints (i.e. whose functions and endpoint names are not expected to change by much within the near future). All webpages within the server can use these endpoints to perform their designated functions.

#### Endpoints
###### "/" - Root
  - Serves requests going out to the server root (i.e. localhost:8080, if using default settings)

###### "/login" - Service Login (Coming Soon)
  - This endpoint services any login POST requests and expects the {TBD} JSON object to be passed via the request header's data section. This can be done using **utility.js**'s **post()** function (or JQuery.ajax() if you know how to use it).

###### "/test" - MongoDB Test Interface
  - This endpoint provides access to a test page that tests basic CRUD operations with the MDBI sub-app. Used for development and testing purposes only, it will be _**disabled**_ in the production version.

###### "/mdbi" - MongoDB Interface Module
  - This endpoint provides restricted access to the MongoDB Database used by Core-v4. See the MDBI readme for more information on the subapp's available endpoints.

###### "/core" - Core-v4 Admin SubApp
  - This endpoint provides access to the Core-v4 Admin portal and dashboard subapp.
