## Cooking Challenge

A message from **our very own Habib:**

Hey everyone! 

Hope you all are doing well and are having a great semester.

This day marks the beginning of our third food competition which will come to a close at the end of this week at 11:59PM on Saturday (11/28). We plan on doing one of these every month, and since Thanksgiving is around the corner, we request that you make your submission this time around Thanksgiving-related.

Rules:
Next Saturday we'll open up a submission channel for you all to submit what you've made. To ensure your submission is valid, you need to submit a photo of you during the cooking process  (you don't have to show your face if it's uncomfortable) as well as the final product! We'll have some judges choose what they think is the best. The winner of this competition will get 1x Discord Classic Nitro (or another gift card of your choice)!

If you're interested in more of the rules check the link below!

I can't wait to see what you all will make!

```
