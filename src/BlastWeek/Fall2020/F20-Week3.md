## Climate Change Panel

Want to learn how YOU can make an impact on the current state of the climate crisis, but youâ€™re not sure where to start?

ML@SJSU will be hosting a panel consisting of industry and academic experts ranging from psychology to computer science to discuss society's modern approaches to tackling the harmful effects of climate change. Each panelist will present a talk about their work and how they're taking their own unique steps towards making a difference. The panelists will then provide insight on how university students like you can make an impact on the climate crisis using their academic background and career goals. 

You will then be able to ask them questions for an one-hour Q&A session. Join our panelist of experts to discuss how students from all academic backgrounds can employ innovative, modern methods to save our planet!
