# SCE Blast Week 12

SCE wants to congratulate all members for finally finishing their finals! Have an incredible winter break!

## SCEGGRAPH Hackathon

Hello all! 

Winter break is a great time to foster your coding skills, and hackathons are a great way to do so! Hosted by SCE and ACM SIGGRAPH, the SCEGGRAPH Hackathon will be on January 8-10, 2021 where you can possibly win a Blue Ice Ball Microphone (1st place) or an Amazon Echo Dot (2nd place)!

The hackathon theme is ‘connecting people virtually,’ and there will be two tracks which students can submit to: the General Track, which is for mainly code-based projects, and the Digital Media Art track, which is for more art-based projects. So if you’d like to make digital art instead, feel free to create a project for the Digital Media Art Track!

We hope to see you at the event!
