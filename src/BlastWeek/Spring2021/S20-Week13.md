If you want to participate in either segment of the club, plan on finishing *Ultralearning* and finishing up to chapter 22 of *Ninth House* by the next meeting!

## Frontend/Backend Developer Opportunity
At our recent general meeting, a group from the SJSU Business Plan Competition presented an amazing opportunity for our members. 

This group is in need of a frontend/backend developer or consultant for their application Gen/US! Gen/US is a user-friendly app that allows family members to share stories and milestones within a personal family network! 

They would need help with:
- Coding the application.
- Creating the user interface.
- Data processing.
- Generating a database.
- User management.

Of course, you also have the assistance of SCE members at any point if you decide to take this opportunity! If you have any questions, contact the members of the team with the information below!
