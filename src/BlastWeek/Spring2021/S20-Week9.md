# SCE Blast Week 9

## SCE Book Club

SCE Book Club is reading two books, one for professional development and the other just for fun!

The professional development book is *Ultralearning* by Scott H. Young, and the other book is *Ninth House* by Leigh Bardugo. 

If you want to participate in either segment of the club, plan on finishing chapter 3 of *Ultralearning* and chapter 6 of *Ninth House* by the next meeting!
