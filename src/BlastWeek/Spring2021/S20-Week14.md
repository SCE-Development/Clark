## Smart Traffic Survey
One of our members Marcus is working on a project to apply hardware and software to implement smart traffic using the concept of IoT! Please fill out the survey linked below to help Marcus out! 

IoT goes well with the concept of AI and getting people's feedback and suggestions, especially from SCE members, might help him consider his approach in this project because the software aspects come into play. This survey is used for analysis on what people think about the what-if potential product before creating.

## Frontend/Backend Developer Opportunity
At our recent general meeting, a group from the SJSU Business Plan Competition presented an amazing opportunity for our members. 

This group is in need of a frontend/backend developer or consultant for their application Gen/US! Gen/US is a user-friendly app that allows family members to share stories and milestones within a personal family network! 

They would need help with:
- Coding the application.
- Creating the user interface.
- Data processing.
- Generating a database.
- User management.

Of course, you also have the assistance of SCE members at any point if you decide to take this opportunity! If you have any questions, contact the members of the team with the information below!
